## **List of VR News Sites Up To Date As Of September 2025**

While browsing the web in search of up-to-date VR and XR news websites, I noticed many existing lists and directories are outdated. Some publications have grown more prominent over the years, while others have gone quiet or shut down. Most older catalogues and lists don't reflect these changes in the fast-evolving world of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Extended Reality (XR).

This list aims to fix that by highlighting some of the most useful, prominent, and regularly updated VR/AR/XR blogs, magazines, and news sites as of September 2025. It's not in any strict order of rank (in fact all outlets are listed alphabetically below), but each entry was chosen for its quality content, industry reputation, and frequency of updates. From long-running independent VR blogs to mainstream tech outlets covering AR, these resources will help you stay informed about the latest developments in immersive tech.

**Below are a list of 15 of the top VR/AR/XR news sites (as of September 2025):**
